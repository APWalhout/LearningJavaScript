const notes = ['Note 1', 'Note 2', 'Note 3'];//note that array items can be of mixed types in JS

console.log(notes.length);//remember documentation on mdn array
console.log(notes[0]);//indices start at 0 as they should!
//note that accessing out of bounds indices doesn't crash or error, it simply returns undefined
